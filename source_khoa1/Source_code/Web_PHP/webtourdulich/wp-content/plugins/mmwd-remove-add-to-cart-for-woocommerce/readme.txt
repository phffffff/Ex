Removes all Add to Cart buttons throughout a WooCommerce website without affecting anything else hooked into the Add to Cart actions.

== Description ==
This plugin removes all Add to Cart buttons throughout a WooCommerce website by using the woocommerce_is_purchasable filter rather than the Add to Cart actions, thus not affecting anything else hooked into these actions. This plugin also offers the option to remove prices in product archive and single product pages.

A new Remove Add to Cart settings tab is added to WooCommerce > Settings > Products with checkboxes to enable the Remove Add to Cart and Remove Prices options.

== Installation ==
Install as usual by going to Plugins > Add New and searching for MMWD Remove Add To Cart for WooCommerce or download the plugin file an upload to your-site.com/wp-content/plugins.
